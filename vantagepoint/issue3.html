                              <strong>Author: Darius Fleischmann</strong><br><br>
                              Privilege &mdash; it is a word used all the time, but often quite loosely. The theory of Social Privilege is the idea that certain groups of people are conferred unearned advantages that are invisible to them. Dr Peggy McIntosh describes (white) privilege to be like an &ldquo;invisible knapsack&rdquo;, in which some people are able to access assets and provisions, tools and advantages that can help them succeed in life without actually having to carry the burden and effort of earning those tools (McIntosh). As a result, those without that privilege usually have to work twice as hard as those that do in order to achieve the same positions in life. <br>
<br>
Everyone has privilege, yet nobody does. Some possess more, others less of it. As part of the giant web of intersectionality, one&rsquo;s privilege can be difficult to quantify and compare with that of others. Privilege presents itself in many forms from more notable aspects like ethnicity, wealth, and education, to less notable ones, like individual attractiveness, physical ablement, and mental health. As a result, what we perceive of someone else is often an incomplete representation of how large the &ldquo;invisible knapsack&rdquo; they carry is. <br>
<br>
Back to the point of &lsquo;invisibility&rsquo;, why do some people refuse to acknowledge their own privilege? When one is called out to be privileged, it is often treated as an assumption that they have led an easy life throughout because of their advantages. This might lead them to anger, cause them to feel defensive, and even be in denial, because this is unquestionably false. Everyone, no matter how privileged, has faced some sort of difficulty in their lifetime and endured their &lsquo;fair&rsquo; share of suffering. Everyone wants people to empathise with their struggles. Besides, nobody wants to feel guilty for a privilege they did not have a choice of accepting. However, it all comes back down to relativity&mdash;the fact that some people have had to endure life more than others (Ebbitt 2015).<br>
<br>
So why should we acknowledge privilege? The reason is simple&mdash;because we&rsquo;re humane. Evolution has allowed us to develop empathy and show compassion for other people, we hate seeing others suffer and we want to change how the marginalized are treated. Systemic privilege hurts everyone, even if not directly. However, change cannot happen if we are unable to even get past the stage of denial and admit that there exist wide gaps in our standards of living. <br>
<br>
When we do think about privilege, however, we tend to focus on what we don&rsquo;t have and overlook the privileges that we do. For instance, a privilege we all share in common without having to earn is the miracle of life. Your chances of being born is at least one in trillions, yet we rarely acknowledge it and take this gift for granted. Therefore, rather than dwelling on certain immutable absences in our lives, we may want to instead make the best version of ourselves with whatever we have been given. <br>
<br>
Privilege is an inevitable part of humanity because nobody is born the same. Variation is after all, key to our survival. All the same time, we have the capacity to stray from nature and decide our own fates. As a collective species and a unified civilization, those conferred greater advantages should lend a helping hand and allow the less privileged to succeed together in running the common race &mdash; the human race.

                        Instead, I relive my days in high school<br>
                        When no matter how good I was<br>
                        I was always the girl with a moustache<br>

                        While your mother&rsquo;s X sits back and pities<br>
                        It&rsquo;s unladylike-ness<br>
                        He doesn&rsquo;t know the teenager<br>

                        And sells you a fair and lovely shade card<br>
                        In the same f****** breath<br>
                        He doesn&rsquo;t know of the hot wax and the laser<br>
                        Whose only purpose is to<br>
                        Replace your innocent skin<br>
                        With its own brand of womanhood<br>

                        In the name of hygiene<br>
                        Hygiene, which when followed by men<br>
                        Makes them gay and unmanly<br>
                        He doesn&rsquo;t know how unruly eyebrows are tamed<br>
                        And how unibrows die a silent death<br>
                        All to preserve beauty<br>

                              FALLEN OR FLOURISHING?<br>
<br>
Tell me, what is the first thing that comes to mind when you think of Broadway? Is it the anticipation you feel right before a show is about to begin? Is it the music from the show that quite literally becomes the soundtrack to your life? Maybe it&rsquo;s the emotion that you didn't even know you could feel or the beautiful costumes that make the performances all the more enchanting. It is crazy how it truly feels as though the entire world has come to a stop, all for the characters to sing their hearts out on a stage. I think I speak for every patron of the arts when I say that Broadway itself is nothing short of an outlandishly fantastic universe.<br>
<br>
 In today&rsquo;s modern world, we are able to see incredible and compelling performances from the likes of great actors and actresses such as: Den&eacute;e Benton, Kimiko Glenn, Ben Platt, and famous Broadway playwright and actor, Lin Manuel Miranda of course. I would say one of the things that I personally love about Broadway is how diverse and full of life the characters are. In fact, cultural diversity and ethnic representation on Broadway is becoming more and more prominent and popular by demand. A few of the most famous shows with a diverse cast of characters and attention grabbing storylines are West Side Story, Hamilton, Bring It On: The Musical, The Colour Purple among other various popular musicals. These shows highlight powerful portrayals of characters and showcase the beauty of cultural diversity on Broadway. <br>
<br>
That being said, it is rather unfortunate to hear that for the past nine years, nonwhite actors have not represented any more than 26 percent of all Broadway roles. Although the numbers for this season are yet to be published due to the global pandemic, the Detroit News communicated that the percentage for minority roles last year actually dropped from 25 percent all the way down to 22 percent. Nevertheless, cultural diversity has indeed come a long way on Broadway, and this is evident in the sense that there are now a variety of shows that celebrate cultural diversity on stage. <br>
<br>
The musical theatre industry often seems to focus many of the classic shows more on white or euro-centric narratives. Sometimes it&rsquo;s either that or, the casts are just not that diverse when it comes to involving people of colour. That does not mean that these shows are innately distasteful and it most certainly doesn&rsquo;t mean that the fun and enjoyment people receive from watching them is taken away from it. What I mean is, with modern Broadway productions that now feature diverse casts, it is imperative that the spotlight shines on them too.<br>
<br>
One would think it&rsquo;s normal for people to want to see a reflection of themselves being represented on stage because it makes them believe that they can be anything they want to be. It is important for Broadway to open its arms wide to people of all backgrounds. Do you think race, gender or sexuality should ever really matter when it comes to casting characters? Talent happens to come from places one would least expect.

                            <p class="steps__card-description">
                              <strong>Author: Aamina Akmal</strong><br><br>
                              In the bustling rhythm of our everyday lives and the seemingly never ending chaos and to-do lists, we sometimes tend to lose our sense of calm and composure. This of course is absolutely acceptable and nothing short of a basic psychological function. Often referred to as anxiety, it is one of the most commonly felt and perfectly normal emotions. The certain sensation of restlessness can be as extreme as manifesting itself as a feeling of impending doom, be it as a result of a big upcoming exam or simply starting off your day. Besides solutions such as seeking therapy, there are a few things that we can do in everyday lives that might help in their own small way in bringing a sense of peace and order into our lives and help alleviate our anxiety to whatever extent that might be. Of course I am in no way claiming to be a professional whatsoever, but I will simply be sharing a few things that I do in my everyday life that have helped me deal with and reduce my own symptoms of anxiety, <br>
<br>
One thing that I think everyone should have and create for themselves, if conditions allow it, is a safe space. This safespace, be it your room, somewhere in the fresh air or simply a little nook in your home will serve as a place of solitude, something along the lines of your own personal bat cave, if you will. Fill this space with things that make you happy and bring you tranquility such as plants, soft pillows and sheets, a diffuser or maybe even a record player. I have personally found that lighting within your safe space is an important aspect to consider, as it can be manipulated to improve your mood. For example, some people might open up windows to let the sunlight stream in in order to feel warm and bright, while others might prefer a cooler, more dimly lit room to calm their nerves. <br>
<br>
Another rather interesting tip that I learned that helped me in perhaps some of the most anxious times, was simply to pop something in your mouth, such as mint or even some hard candy. Picture this: you&rsquo;re about to enter the exam room. There is a general sense of nervousness floating through the air paired with the erratic pacing of your classmates and you begin to feel the familiar sensation of anxiousness creeping up on you. In this situation, eating something fresh and cooling will almost always help bring about some sense of relief. This is because it is impossible for our body to consume something and stay anxious at the same time. Anxiety is a primitive instinct used by humans to prepare us for dangerous situations. When we eat something, our body immediately realises that there is no need for this extreme anxiousness, as we would not tend to eat when faced with imminent danger and it begins to relax and cool down. <br>
<br>
Last but not least, one of the most frequent things that we&rsquo;re told to do when anxious is to breathe. Slowing down and taking deep breaths helps in bringing you back to reality and grounding yourself. Sometimes your mind needs a little extra push to remind you that you&rsquo;re alright and bring you down to reality. Breathing deeply and slowly all the while, list:<br>
<br>
Five things you see around you<br>
Four things you can reach out and touch <br>
Three things you can hear <br>
Two things you can smell <br>
And finally going back to our previous tip, one thing you can taste<br>
Using this simple technique during times of anxiousness helps engage all five of your senses and aids in bringing our anxious minds to rest and back to reality. <br>
<br>
Grounding ourselves and taking good care of ourselves is especially important in the 21st century world that we live in today, our lives seemingly flying past in a blink. These tips are just a small fraction of the enormous amount of helpful information that can be found in regards to coping with the extremely common emotion of anxiety. <br>
<br>
Although, I do hope this article helped in its own little way :) Remember to breathe deeply and have fun!

                            <p class="steps__card-description">

                                Think of a classic movie antagonist - a big bad bully who only causes trouble and torments the protagonist. It is so easy to think that these people only exist as fictional characters, and that may be true as it is rare to see those stereotypes. However, bullying has shape-shifted, and it is still so prevalent today (Facts About Bullying, 2021). It has been responsible for so many lives being tainted with self doubt and self loathing that addressing bullying has become an even more important issue to talk about.<br />
                        <br />
                        Two years ago it was reported that 1 out of 4 students in Singapore are bullied or have experienced bullying (Lim, 2021). Fortunately, there are a few different categories that help to better understand the different types of bullying (Singapore Children's Society, 2021).<br />
                        <br />
                        First up is physical bullying. Physical bullying has long become taboo in many societies, and many schools have zero-tolerance policies for it. However, when thinking of bullying, physical bullying is the usual stereotype, which can blind many people from seeing other toxic behaviours in their communities that are considered bullying.<br />
                        <br />
                        What are those harmful behaviours? Well, they can be separated into relational and verbal bullying. This includes even small things spreading rumours or, even in a joking manner, malicious teasing, ridiculing, and intimidating someone else. The true issue lies in underestimating the effects of such actions on the recipients; with enough time that they are made fun of for their hair or style or race or gender or grades, the more likely it is that those are going to have an impact in the long term.<br />
                        <br />
                        With the sudden development of youths using technology, cyber bullying has unfortunately evolved too. The whole reason why it is so prevalent is because it feels so harmless to write impertinent comments and jokes when it all happens virtually; when all the words are being cast out into the great and endless void of other rude words. However, virtual or verbal, words can sting beyond what many of the bullies intend.<br />
                        <br />
                        So here is the question that haunts all school assemblies and mental-health advocates? Of course, there is no universal answer for an issue that includes so many people, however, perhaps the only way to understand it would be through a paradox. Bullying is the result of lack of unity, and yet it leads to more people lacking unity. Bullies are just people who, at some point in their lives, lacked or lack a supportive community who provide a sense of unity, and thus, bullies find satisfaction in isolating others instead.<br />
                        <br />
                        School communities, workplaces, and households all need to take a leap into compassion for bullying to come to an end, as it will open the window of deeper understanding of others, as well as an open mind. <br />
                        <br />
                        Unity is something that can be achieved through changing the perspectives in current society, and with the passion and empathy of the younger generations, change is already around the corner.<br />
                        <br />
                        If you are being bullied, feel like you are contributing to bullying, or are noticing abusive behaviour in your peers, don&rsquo;t stay silent and hidden. Seek help, so that the future could become brighter.

Who are you? Who am I? <br>
<br>
Does identity matter if all you are is what others require you to be?<br>
<br>
What is the significance of identity when you are what others require you to be- the stereotypical and unconventional you. <br>
<br>
In our society no one is truly happy. Unrealistic standards distort our reality and perception of ourselves. Insecurity and doubt is inescapable. The glass screens of our devices reflect off all that we are not&#8230; I&rsquo;m sure you know all this all too well. To answer the question above I am Cynthia Aung and I find it quite ironic of me to be writing this since &lsquo;Cynthia&rsquo; is not my birth name- alien to my identity.<br>
<br>
What does it mean to be a sheep? When you are called sheep you are typically referred to as someone who is easily influenced by the action and opinions, and beliefs of others out of fear of not fitting in. From larger instances like being peer pressured into actions you're reluctant doing, to smaller instances like daily decisions.<br>
<br>
Let&rsquo;s face it. Everyone has acted sheepishly multiple times in their life. It&rsquo;s inevitable. Following the crowd is a human instinct. We feel the need to surround ourselves with others when lonely. We were made to interact with one another which made us vulnerable to the desire to blend in. <br>
<br>
But, there is a fine line between yearning to belong and becoming sheepish. &#8203;<br>
<br>
Identity makes you who you are; belonging to a group should co-exist with that. The two are not meant to excuse each other. Contrasting identities brings individuals together; unique bonds and new ideas are formed. Just imagine a homogenous population. 7 billion of the same personality. <br>
<br>
Divergence makes us unique and gives us individuality, plus, scientifically speaking- 7 billion of the same person can cause everyone to be infected by the same disease and possibly have humankind wiped out; if the world had the same people we would have been dead from Covid months ago). <br>
<br>
Separate your identity from stereotypes. Simply because your identity is stereotyped, you are in no way obliged to follow those rules or act a certain type of way for the pleasure and entertainment of others. There is a &lsquo;perfect male&rsquo;, &lsquo; perfect female&rsquo; and &lsquo;perfect human&rsquo; gender mold that we feel a need to fit into. This is where the terms such as &lsquo;toxic masculinity&rsquo; has risen. Due to the standards such as; &lsquo;masculine&rsquo;, &lsquo;apathetic' and &lsquo;man of the house&rsquo; that has been put upon males, many struggle to express themselves and find themselves trying to fit into the stereotype set for them. <br>
<br>
A fellow friend of mine commented:<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I struggled with my identity when moving from place to place. I come from Australia. Living in Singapore as someone who lived in Australia most of my life gave me a culture shock. It was surprising how diverse and unique everyone was. Society has standards for men to be strong and apathetic. That affected me whenever I was feeling down and someone said man up. I feel the need to belong with others and start conversations to avoid loneliness. This has made me do some sheepish things in the past.&rdquo; <br>
<br>
These stereotypical gender roles and unrealistic standards leave an effect on today's society, more so to adolescents in search of their true identity. Moreover, countless numbers of people have attempted to break misconceptions and expectations. Take renowned artist Harry Styles for example; the first male in vogue in feminine clothing. Although I can argue that clothing has no gender, the clothing that he and several other feminine dressed men wear is often criticized by many for not dressing as the typically assigned clothing. I find it inspiring that there are people like him that are encouraging others to differentiate themselves from what is expected of them. I hope that this article has opened your eyes and will help you find who you truly are without the restrictions of expectations on you. <br>

Fun Fact: <br>
Scientifically speaking- 7 billion of the same person can cause everyone to be infected by the same disease and possibly have humankind wiped out; if the world had the same people we would have been dead from Covid months ago.
