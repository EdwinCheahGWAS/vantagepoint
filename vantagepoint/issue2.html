                              When you think of Hollywood, you think of glamour, fame and wealth.Your mind immediately thinks of extravagant parties and red carpets right? However, do you think of representation? Should you think about representation? <br />
<br />
For years and years, Hollywood has been a massive, untouchable industry that many have tried to get their hands on. It is a one way ticket to success, that if attained will guarantee to set out life for you. It is almost perfect, really, for both the performer and audience; the actor gets to participate in something they love and the audience receives the entertainment. It is &ldquo;almost&rsquo; perfect because the target audience in question is a very limited group of people. Because when you think of Hollywood, you think white. <br />
<br />
Due to its nature, Hollywood has a large influence on people all over the world. It is one of the primary sources of entertainment for many, almost by default. You can find Hollywood movies in every nook and corner of the world. Now, this isn&rsquo;t inherently a bad thing; under a different lense, it can be viewed as the one source of entertainment that unites the whole world due to the majority&rsquo;s shared interest in it. Though this should be seen as pro, it is also where the problem arises and here&rsquo;s why.<br />
<br />
From a young age, eager eyes from all around the world look forward to catching glimpses of the new &ldquo;It&rdquo; movie that everyone seems to be taken with. It consists of the same cliche concept portrayed in a foreign way which makes it so mesmerising, the anticipation to watch it keeps building. When those young, excited eyes finally get to watch this film, they are met with the familiar sight of that one popular actor present in every film. The same one who&rsquo;s granted these roles because of their charms and good looks, looks that don&rsquo;t match any of these children. <br />
<br />
Growing up while watching hundreds of other films from the biggest entertainment industry that follow the same pattern of not seeing yourself and your culture being portrayed leads to a low self esteem. It makes children feel excluded, like they don&rsquo;t belong. They don't have that one person in films and tv who looks like them or even something as silly as dress up for halloween as. A study performed by Nicole Martins in 2012 looked at a sample of 400 kids and how Hollywood influences their self esteem. The only group of children who weren&rsquo;t negatively impacted by the media were white boys because they were most represented by the media. Other children from different races felt deprived of that representation which led to a multitude of problems including a lower self esteem. This is why it is important to have a diverse cast with people of all colours and genders; for people to feel represented and seen, for kids to have someone to look up to. Additionally, having a more representative group of individuals also creates pathways for fresh ideas through the showcasing of new cultures.<br />
<br />
So in our multicultural world, when one thinks of Hollywood, one does think of glamour, fame and wealth. However, one should also think about representation due to all the benefits that come with it such as a diverse cast. We should aim for inclusivity everywhere, and what better way to start than through a large platform like hollywood?

                              <strong>Author: Devika Shernoy</strong><br><br>

                              Fashion. A form of self-expression of people. Trends come and go, but what about inclusivity and representation? According to ALL PARTY PARLIAMENTARY GROUP FOR TEXTILES AND FASHION report, 75.4%* of those surveyed believed that the fashion industry does not represent a spectrum of diverse bodies and identities. The fashion industry&rsquo;s deep roots in sectionalising minorities, POC, differently-abled people and more should change. By bringing in representation, it will help be useful for companies and customers. The reasons below discuss why diversification and representation is needed in the fashion industry. <br />
<br />
Diversifying Models Can Help Celebrate Racial, Physical, and Gender Differences.<br />
<br />
People often don&rsquo;t get a chance to voice their thoughts and express their creativity. This happened with Mecca James-Williams, a black stylist and editor, who said that the &ldquo;lack of access&rdquo; is a problem and once that access is given, then getting &ldquo;disfranchised&rdquo; and &ldquo;tokenized&rdquo; is problematic. People are often forced into a stereotype, just like James-Williams stated. To add to that Amanda Murray, a black stylist and branding consultant, said that the lack of representation gives unsafe vibes as she is unable to see people like her. (Turner)<br />
<br />
Similar cases have happened to minorities. Somriddho Dasgupta, an androgenous model stated that his first experience in the industry was &ldquo;exploitative&rdquo; due to the brands&rsquo; agenda of seeming diverse and inclusive. (Khalili-Tari)<br />
<br />
This can all be stopped as the fashion industry has the capacity to change this through its explosive reach, utilizing it to represent and celebrate the acceptance of differences. Differently sized bodies will be celebrated and viewed as normal and human. Different types of people, including differently-abled people, LGBTQIA+, and more to show a varying range of thought, perspectives, and help the industry flourish. This allows for beauty standards and fashion to be the voice for all, rather than the voices of a few. <br />
<br />
Representation Helps Generate Revenue. <br />
<br />
Minority groups have huge spending power. People with disabilities have a spending power of &ldquo;&pound;249billion.&rdquo; This means that the company is losing a lot of potential market and profit because only 0.01-0.02% of current fashion advertisements target people with disabilities (THE ALL-PARTY PARLIAMENTARY GROUP FOR TEXTILES AND FASHION). By seeing different types of people, customers can relate more. The 1994 research called &quot;A Tale of Two Cities: Distinctiveness Theory and Advertising Effectiveness&quot; by Rohit Deshpand&eacute; and Douglas M. Stayman entails that minority customers respond more positively to commercials aimed toward their minority status. (De La Cruz) Furthermore, companies and brands will be the forerunner for change, garnering automatic attention.<br />
<br />
Having Representation and Diversification in Fashion Can Reduce Dissatisfaction With People&rsquo;s Own Bodies. <br />
<br />
Studies show that social media and the fashion industry&rsquo;s pursuit for thinness and the stereotypical image make customers and readers foster dissatisfaction within themselves. This makes the public foster unrealistic expectations of beauty and fashion. The sociocultural theory (Thompson et al., 1999), states that internalisation of media creates different levels of dissatisfaction. If a person has had levels of internalisation of this unrepresentative media, then they may not be affected due to the high amount of dissatisfaction already harboured leaving space for no more. Whereas, a person with a lesser amount of internalisation, will be more susceptible to be influenced by stereotypical ideals (Swiatkowski). Ultimately, the skewed perspective of fashion and beauty standards can lead to a lot of mental health issues (Mayo Clinic Staff). <br />
<br />
By diversifying and representing groups of people, companies can gain a market and have a loyal customer base. Furthermore, representation and inclusivity mean that fashion can be owned by all. Lastly, representation can also reduce negative relationships with the body and celebrate imperfections.<br />

                            <div class="steps__card-number" style="background-color: #7a6152;">"I am not a label" Review</div>
                            <p class="steps__card-description">
                              <strong>Author: Cynthia Aung</strong><br><br>

                              &lsquo;I Am Not A Label&rsquo; is an anthology book that contains stories of 34 role models who shaped history and our society with their art, innovations, activism, and talents. Each page is filled with illustrative drawings and mini-biographies dedicated to giving proper recognition of disabled figures of history. Although it is aimed at children and young adults, this book should also be read by adults as well. <br>
<br>
Starring notable figures such as Helen Keller, Terry Fox, Beethoven, and Lady Gaga, Burnwell manages to write about a diverse range of influencers from the past and present. This form of diversity is beneficial for children as they will have role models from a range of different backgrounds, interests, sexualities, ethnicities, and skills to look up to. Baldo, the illustrator, smartly ties Burwell's written pieces to a specific colour theme and style of illustrations for each specific person. This shows their expertise in the field as they know that their audience, dominantly children may be more entertained and engaged when seeing different shapes, colours and details to fulfill their sensory needs. As the details and colour palettes are quite flexible and appealing, they are suitable for adults as well.<br>
<br>
It is important for books such as &lsquo;I Am Not A Label&rsquo; to deserve its recognition since the media, especially in children&rsquo;s literature and films, lacks proper representation of disabled figures. Although there has been an increase in representation of disabled figures in children&rsquo;s media such as Netflix&rsquo;s shows like &lsquo;The Babysitter&rsquo;s Club&rsquo; or Lego&rsquo;s toy campaign &lsquo;#ToyLikeMe&rsquo;, many mainstream media outlets for kids such as Nickelodeon or Disney Channel currently have no shows featuring a main or prominent disabled character (3). Without the proper representation, children will grow up without seeing people representing their communities, which could lead to feeling alone, isolated, and even ashamed of themselves. <br>
<br>
The author, Cerrie Burrell, personally states at the start of the book that she longed to see herself reflected in the heroes of the books and movies she saw as a kid. &ldquo;I was born with one hand and for some of my childhood even had an actual hook, so really, I looked much like a stereotypical pirate than the hero of the story&rdquo;. <br>
<br>
Growing up with disabilities it is easier to see characters portrayed as the &lsquo;villian&rsquo; like Burrell&rsquo;s experience with pirates. One may argue that that is a form of representation however stereotyped portrayals like this may do more harm than good. <br>
<br>
So, what is the difference between the lack of representation and improper representation? Both are equally damaging to the growing generation but with improper representation. The Cooperative Children&rsquo;s Book Center has published data results stating that only 3.4% of children&rsquo;s books have disabled main characters (Kingsbury). Without proper representation, ableism and stigma around disability continue being the norm and negative stereotypes continue to affect communities. Disabilities given proper representation will be beneficial for the able-bodied as well as they will be educated to diversity and will be encouraged to stop the cycle of ableism. <br>
<br>
Growing up as a girl of colour, I had little to no representation in the media. Even if I did, the characters were stereotyped into smart, petite, and shy girls like &lsquo;Cho Chang&rsquo; from Harry Potter. Or were played by white actors and actresses like Scarlet Johansen in &lsquo;Ghost in the Shell&rsquo;. I had the privilege of attending international schools but it had always struck a chord for me when I saw other kids get proper representation in the media which led me to feel as if I wasn&rsquo;t heard because no one had portrayed my community properly. <br>
<br>
&ldquo;Gender and ethnicity are very high on the agenda, but disability has always been less visible- (most representation) still relates to things like Children in Need, the charity &lsquo;poster child.&rdquo; - Dr. Amy Holdsworth. To conclude this review, I believe that a book like this has the power to change mindsets and empower children as it is a collection of influential figures with disabilities. <br>
<br>
There are also featured sections of invisible disabilities such as mental health and sections educating the youth about the harm of using disabled people as &lsquo;inspiration&rsquo;. The title, &ldquo;I Am Not A Label&rdquo; is an affirmation telling kids that they are more than the label and the stereotype harshly placed on them. Having a book like this may pave the way for future books to start representing a more diverse selection of characters for their younger readers.

                            <div class="steps__card-number" style="background-color: #7a6152;">A complicated facet of ourselves</div>
                            <p class="steps__card-description">
                              <strong>Author: Ishnaa Goenka</strong><br><br>
                              We students are taught many things in school, such as how to do maths, how to read and write, etc but we&rsquo;re rarely ever taught about mindfulness or mental health and its importance. One of these areas that remain untouched is our &lsquo;Identity.&rsquo; It's what makes up who we are and more importantly, how we perceive and express ourselves. It's important lies in if we have a positive or negative image of ourselves, our perception of ourselves affects our confidence, attitude and personality, just to name a few. Its importance is highly undervalued which is why I interviewed our school counsellor, Mr Kevin Dunk for his views from a psychological perspective on how to deal and work with our identity. <br>
<br>
What happens when students think of themselves or base their self worth from one aspect of their identity, for example, academics? <br>
<br>
&ldquo;I think it can be damaging and I think it can put young people under an enormous amount of pressure because we are categorizing ourselves from such an early age. We&rsquo;re placing our identity in academics or placing our identity in family or religion or occupation. If you're an adult, I think it's dangerous because the whole thing is much more than that. We&rsquo;re all made up of lots of different things and that expands culture, background, and yes religion and family. So we&rsquo;re kind of made up of so many different ingredients so therefore it becomes dangerous and potentially damaging if we then only see ourselves through that one particular lens.&rdquo; <br>
<br>
What should we do to grow from an unhealthy perception of self to a healthier one? <br>
<br>
&ldquo;We should look at it from a more holistic kind of view and I think that comes with recognition. Recognizing that we are made up of many many different facets of our lives and if we lump it all together and focus just on our academic performance then that can be damaging. What we do in counselling is encourage students to map it out, map out our identity. I like to think in terms of narratives. A mind map, cartoon script, about recognizing our own narratives. And those different facets of identity form the narrative of your life.&rdquo; <br>
<br>
Why is it important what we think of ourselves? <br>
<br>
&ldquo;It links back to self worth, if we didn't have identity, as a big caption, then who are we? I think it's equally dangerous to identify with only one thing. But also identity is what makes us and that's essentially the ingredients if we&rsquo;re the meal at the table.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
What are things students regularly associate themselves with that might not be healthy?<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Image, physical image and perceiving the way you look physically is your identity can be unhealthy. I think there's a lot of pressure on young people to look a certain way, to fit a certain image because that's going to create identity and I think that's definitely unhealthy.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Do you think it's important to build on your identity? <br>
<br>
&ldquo;For some people it's very strong, they have a strong sense of identity, whereas other students and people may struggle to find that sense of identity but they do have it. So I think it's maybe about just helping students and young people to recognize that they all have it, all have an identity, all have a story. Recognizing the facets of your identity but not being obsessed with it. Improving their self image is about accepting who you are and loving who you are. It's about self acceptance and when talking about physical self, it's about looking in the mirror and being okay and liking the person you see and trying not to conform to those media representations and stereotypes.&rdquo; <br>
<br>
Essentially, identity like all other things is complicated, will take time to figure out and is something that is always changing and growing with you. When you feel lost, going back to the plethora of things that make you can be a way to grow and re-find your sense of self. Just remember it is just another form of self expression.

                            <p class="steps__card-description">
                              <strong>Author: XCL Dialogue</strong><br><br>

                              Stop thinking global, start thinking galactic.<br>
<br>
That was the core of Chris R. Burggraeve&rsquo;s message during his XCL Dialogue presentation. Specializing in marketing and finance, Burggraeve has 32+ years of experience, even writing notable books such as Marketing is Not a Black Hole and MARKETING is FINANCE is BUSINESS: How CMO, CFO and CEO cocreate iconic brands with sustainable pricing power in the new Galactic Age. If you&rsquo;re familiar with his works, you might have noticed his continuous theme surrounding the galaxy, something he linked back to during his presentation on the third of November. <br>
<br>
In our day and age, the world of science fiction is becoming science reality. Back then, space travel was represented by the first footprint Neil Armstrong planted on the moon. Now, space travel has evolved to the point where Tesla can launch one of their cars into space and come back unharmed. Burggraeve himself had a fascination with space since he was young, reading stories of Tin-Tin and his adventure to the moon. Since then, he had kept up with space investment, becoming one of the many who decided to buy a ticket for commercial space travel. <br>
<br>
His focus on space continued to highlight issues such as xenophobia, sexism, and racism. Framing it through the world of marketing, Burggraeve used the &ldquo;Overview Effect&rdquo; and further elaborated on its power to unite. Describing it as a life changing event by astronauts who had the opportunity to see our planet from space, they saw no borders; no lines on a map dividing us into boxes and nationalities. They just saw the world, our world. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t see division, you see unity,&rdquo; were the words Burggraeve used to describe the &ldquo;Overview Effect&rdquo; and while he has yet to experience it, it is his hope that everyone will one day be able to. <br>
<br>
But why should we care about investing in space and the galaxy? Recognizing the opposition to space investment, he acknowledged the problems of poverty and climate change a great deal. When you look at the research put into space by the military, you come to realize that a large portion of our daily products and services are derived from such research. For example, the internet was a result of satellite creation, giving us the connections and online opportunities we have now. Companies have been testing and thinking about the galactic future ahead of us whether we realize it or not. All those sci-fi movies are becoming a reality, and now private companies are becoming players in the international space race. <br>
<br>
&ldquo;The impact of space research on our daily lives is the biggest untold story of our time,&rdquo; were the words Burggraeve used to exemplify this. To him, the investment into space was another way to bring other world issues to light, hence his focus on asking questions with &ldquo;and&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;or.&rdquo; What can we do to further space exploration and create an equal and inclusive world? How do we bring people out of poverty and create space for them in the galaxy? Those were the questions Burggraeve insisted we ask. Even he encouraged us, our generation, to ask the hard, existential questions no one wants to be asked. <br>
<br>
So once again, in the words of Chris R. Burggraeve himself:<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Leave your comfort zone. Great learning happens when you leave your comfort zone. Go and live internationally, go and discover the planet and you&rsquo;ll discover your own country. Similarly, I would now say to anybody listening, leaving your comfort zone is not any more than leaving the planet. Leave the planet, if you can. Think galactic, and I wish you good luck.&rdquo;

He doesn&rsquo;t know of the hot wax and the laser<br>
Whose only purpose is to<br>
Replace your innocent skin<br>
With its own brand of womanhood<br>
He doesn&rsquo;t know of the veet and the bleach<br>
That uproot your robust hair <br>
In the name of hygiene<br>
Hygiene, which when followed by men<br>
Makes them gay and unmanly<br>
He doesn&rsquo;t know how unruly eyebrows are tamed<br>
And how unibrows die a silent death<br>
All to preserve beauty<br>
And of the torturous miracles that happen<br>
Inside the doors marked<br>
&ldquo;WOMEN ONLY&rdquo;<br>
So when a man calls me beautiful<br>
I throw at him, a smile; a smile that remained<br>
After everything the strip pulled away<br>
And I dare him<br>
To wait<br>
&lsquo;Till my hair grows back.

                              At this point, we have all seen the news about the Taliban&rsquo;s return, taking over Afghanistan. But, what happened afterward? <br>
<br>
The Taliban is a military organization that started its attacks in 1990. They were removed from power back in 2001 by US forces. In 2021 when the Taliban group had started gaining power back, the US then announced their withdrawal from Afghanistan which then quickly allowed the Taliban to seize control of Afghanistan on September 7th, 2021. There was little resistance from the Afghan army and as political leaders fled the country, the Taliban entered Afghanistan&rsquo;s capital, Kabul to reside in the presidential palace. <br>
<br>
After gaining access to Kabul, they officially took over Afghanistan. Fear and anger spread worldwide, especially for women as questions of equal rights in Afghanistan rose.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I am in big shock,&rdquo; Zahra, 26 worker for a non-profit feminist organization, told AP. &ldquo;How can it be possible for me as a woman who has worked so hard and tried to learn and advance, to now have to hide myself and stay at home?&rdquo; (1) Women&rsquo;s education and power over their own bodies has been taken from them. They can only go outside if they are escorted by a male relative. On top of that, the Taliban has visited houses to take women from ages 12-45 to wed their soldiers. <br>
<br>
&quot;Women and children are suffering the most and our forces are trying to save democracy. The world should understand and help us.&quot; <br>
<br>
Innocent civilians living in Afghanistan are no longer safe. A UN report shown above shows the casualties made by the Taliban who were responsible for 64% of these casualties with 34% being children. As of August 16th 2021, the UNHCR has declared hundreds of thousands Afghanistans displaced and estimated that half a million may leave at the end of 2021. Countries like Canada have volunteered to take in 20,000 refugees from groups like the LGBTQIA+, human rights activists and women leaders. However, most refugee groups are isolated and placed in unsafe camps such as the US airbase in Qatar where video footage released evidence of unsafe living conditions with the majority not having spare clothes to wear. Afghan refugees were shown to be placed under uncomfortable heat for hours to wait in lines to receive necessities such as food and water or a restroom until some had reportedly lost consciousness. <br>
<br>
Similar reports of mistreatment were made in Doha, Qatar. &ldquo;A humid day today. Where the Afghans are housed is a living hell. Trash, urine, fecal matter, spilled liquids and vomit cover the floors.&rdquo; - experts from US embassy staff (Aljaheeza)<br>

As the third of the population struggles from malnutrition, the World Food Programme disclosed information that they may run out of their main supply of food, wheat flour, by October. With the circumstances of Covid-19, the Taliban and increasing poverty, Afghanistan needs our help more than ever. The UN stated in July 2021 that nearly half of the population, 18.5 million people, were in need of humanitarian support. <br>
<br>
For our upcoming fundraiser we are asking for help from you in donating money and supplies to help protect these vulnerable people during this dangerous time with winter approaching. Please listen out for messages from your Homeroom Teachers on iSAMS for more information on this.
