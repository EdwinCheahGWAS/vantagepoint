                                Many use the term “multicultural environment” when describing topics such as their  work environment, society, community, and more. A multicultural environment is a society with different cultural or ethnic groups. But an intercultural environment is a society where people of different cultural or ethnic groups have mutual respect and deep understanding of every person with a heterogeneous societal culture. <br> <br>An intercultural environment allows for varied perspectives and lens on a subject matter. It builds confidence, identity, and empathy. It prepares students for their future in a work environment. It leads to compassion instead of judgment, understanding in lieu of ignorance, appreciation as opposed to depreciation. Intercultural environments change one’s perception of their surroundings.<br><br>According to the school website, there are a profusion of 72 nationalities in XCL World Academy, with not one dominant culture or background. It is evident that our school community values diversity and celebrates our differences through festivals, language and culture week, where students get the opportunity to dress up in national costumes whether theirs or others. Students also get the chance to share their traditions, thoughts, values and beliefs. This being said, I spoke to many staff and students to find out more about their experiences in an intercultural environment. Here are their comments. <br><br>
<strong>What were your first impressions of XCL’s cultural diversity?</strong><br>
Diverse, everyone comes from a different background and nationality
<br><br>


<strong>How do you think cultural diversity in school affects the environment? What about your education?</strong>
<br>
I think it affects how people in the community accept each other’s differences. I think it affects my education because with diversity, we can learn more about other cultures too.
<br><br>

<strong>How does the cultural diversity in school affect you personally?</strong>
<br>
I think it affects me personally by teaching me to have more tolerance and become more accepting of others although there are differences.
<br><br>

<strong>One word to describe our school’s cultural diversity.</strong>
<br>
Diverse.
<br><br>

<strong>How is this school different from your previous school when you were a child?</strong>
<br>
I think it is different because XWA is a lot more diverse and has students with a variety of nationalities and backgrounds.
<br><br>

<strong>What do you think everyone can do to promote diversity and inclusivity?</strong>
<br>
By being accepting and understanding towards others and respecting differences.
<br><br>

With a diverse demographic in Singapore, especially in schools, we are building a future generation that will not only learn to “passively” coexist or tolerate others with a different upbringing or background, but rather, build mutual respect and understanding for a sustainable present and future. It’s imperative for us to put aside our cultural differences and unite.

<strong>Do you remember your first day in high school as a student? How was it and what did you feel?</strong><br><br>
Dr. Strozzo:  My first day in high school...I am going to be honest, I don't remember my first day in high school, but I remember the vibe of the actual year because we moved just next door. Our school was a middle school next to the high school. It wasn't a huge change, but at the same time, I remember all of the older kids looking at all of us like, "oh the little kids are here now!" And I thought I was big and bad because I was the oldest at the last school. So I guess nervousness is what I remember, but not the first day.Though, I remember the first year of University! My University was still in the same state in the US. I moved about 4 hours North from a small town with literally nobody and cornfields to Atlanta, which is one of the biggest cities in the US. My roommate and I were living slap downtown Atlanta and I had only been there a couple of times. So to me, a skyscraper was a big deal, there weren't those where I grew up. So I remember my roommate and I go up to our very first class which for some stupid reason we had set for 8:00 in the morning. That first morning was so awesome because I was walking around, there were cars and people, there were hotdog stands. I was so excited, then all of us got to class and fell asleep.
<br><br>
Mr. Heard: I remember having to wear a new school uniform when we went to high school. It was the first time when we moved out from middle school to the high school which was next door but at the same time, there were students coming from 3 other local middle schools join in our high school. So, there was an influx of new people, new boys, new girls, new interests, and of course, the potential for bullying. We had been told about bullying in high school and in those days bullying definitely existed so I remember being incredibly nervous. I remember having to go from the safety of the middle school where you had your main class teacher and occasional specialist lessons like PE and design to a whole new school where you moved around for Science, Geography, history, German, French, Chemistry, Physics, Biology. So, being organized was hard, fitting in was hard, finding your way around your new school, deciding which toilets you could go to safely was tough. I do remember being nervous
<br><br>
Ms. Cousino: I honestly don’t remember the exact first day of high school but I certainly do remember the first year. I remember that during the first quarter it was very difficult for me to adapt to the new academic demands, especially on the marks side. So I had a hard time adjusting myself to those demands. However, throughout the year step by step, little by little, I became, I would say mature, and I understood that in the end with effort everything is achievable.
<br><br>
Ms. Manson: I remember my first day at high school was actually very difficult because I went completely to a different school from all my other friends. So, I was the only one there and I didn’t know anyone. So I was really scared to start off with but I made friends really really quickly because I got involved in lots of sports and lots of arts. After that, all was good.

<br><br>
<strong>How do you think it differs from the first day as a teacher?</strong><br><br>
Dr. Strozzo:  As a teacher, I was more nervous than when I was a student because as a teacher you’re expected to be an expert in an area. When I first started teaching, I started as a middle school science teacher. My major in University for not science, even though I always loved science and I have always been a nerd about all that stuff. So I had apprehension of going into class and not being fully aware of what students might ask me. After that, because the students were positive and encouraging, I fell into my groove.
<br><br>
Mr. Heard: The first day as a qualified teacher is different from the first day of teaching practice because to become a qualified teacher you have to first do at least 4 teaching practices, and my first day as a teacher in teaching practice, I was incredibly nervous. I stood in front of the class for the first time and I started ….I wasn’t very confident, I wasn’t particularly well prepared and I wasn’t that much older than the secondary students that I was teaching at that time. So I remember being very nervous. As I became better prepared, and more used to the sound of my own voice and the tools that you’ve had, the whiteboard and preparing worksheets, I got better. So, I remember being just as nervous as an adult starting teaching as I was as a student starting secondary school.
<br><br>
Ms. Cousino: As a teacher, I am on the other side, and I don't know if I want to talk about the difference, but I want to say that I feel empathy for my students, mostly for those that are struggling at the beginning. I know it is difficult to adapt because besides academics you have social commitments, you want to belong to someplace. So, you have a lot of demands from their community, and from your parents, and this uncertainty of where you are going to end right in the university. I feel empathetic for you guys. I really feel that I am here to support the academics beyond the Spanish class.
<br><br>
Ms. Manson: As a first day as a teacher, it’s different. The first day as a teacher you are more mature and already grown up so you have already got your own friends outside of your job and whereas in high school it feels like your friends and your school have to be together which they don’t have to.

<br><br>
<strong>What tips would you give to students for the start of the semester - to take on the school year and for exams?</strong><br><br>
Dr Strozzo: It is not the end of the world if you haven’t done your best in an assignment. I know this is not what all teachers would say because it is important, but at the end of the day, you need to be well and take a deep breath and understand that the world is going to keep going, no matter if you fail your physics IA or not. And that the teachers and staff at the school are all here to help you. In terms of stress management, you need to schedule yourself and realise there’s a lot of stuff going on, and you will get it done if you can think of it as one task at a time.
<br><br>
Mr Heard: Make sure to be prepared. Make sure you have got a good night's sleep, you are well-rested, you have had breakfast, you have done the work that you have set for each lesson, just like as a teacher and our students expect us to have marked work on time if we set you a piece of homework try and do the reading which is necessary be focused in class and you can only be focused if you get a good night’s sleep.
<br><br>
Ms. Cousino: My suggestion is first don’t freak out. Everything has a solution, except death. Besides that, everything has a solution, and my suggestion with the academics is to have good organisation skills and self-management skills. Eat well and sleep well. Don’t waste your time. Don’t stay longer on your phone checking at stupidities that don’t help you to rest. Leave the phone on the side, rest, and eat properly.
<br><br>

<strong>What is the most interesting thing that happened to you during your school years?</strong><br><br>
Dr. Strozzo: The most interesting teacher was when I was in high school, she was our history teacher. Her name was Tiffany Todd. In one class nobody asked anything as she randomly walked into the class completely in character as a US revolutionary war general. She walked in like she was this big, high-flying general and started yelling at us for like 30 mins. She went on and on and on in this monologue (she was also a drama teacher) about how and why we needed to get our spirits up to defeat the British. It was so impactful to us because we didn't realise that she was teaching us but when she dropped character and she sat down. Everybody was stunned in silence, and then about 10 minutes later, she stood up and said, “So, what did we learn today?” Then we realised that all of the stuff she had done in her acting was exactly what was on the syllabus.
<br><br>
Mr Heard: I think many of you won’t know that I was a geography teacher, that I qualified as a geography teacher but nobody ever wanted geography teachers when I qualified. Back then, we had to do a geography river study or a geographical study and I remember really falling in love with geography and geology, and going into the field and doing fieldwork. I spent many weekends floating oranges down different stretches of rivers to measure the velocity of water, waiting across rivers measuring the depth at 10 cm intervals across the river, and I actually found out that I really liked fieldwork. I really like gaining an understanding of how the earth was formed. I guess I had gone through school up all the way up until that point being told what to do but when you have a personal project like in MYP, where you actually go out and you do something that you are passionate about, then I found that I actually was a good student and I had, I could apply all of the knowledge that I was taught in school and for me, that was something I wish I had learned earlier because I didn’t learn until I was grade 11 student at which I suddenly realised how much I liked learning.
<br><br>
Ms. Cousino: When I was in grade 11 there were elections for the student council committee. Every grade had a representative but nobody from my grade applied for treasurer. So, I just raised my hand like a clown, like, “I can do it,” and then everybody took it seriously. I actually had to play a role as a candidate with the student council and I got the place out of nowhere because I didn’t really think about that at that moment. It ended up being really fun and I learned a lot from that because I never occupied administrative posts in the school. I was always on the side of sports, cheerleaders, and that kind of thing. So, this experience, which was only for a year, was a nice experience to explore more.
<br><br>
Ms. Manson: The most interesting student I ever had was a student who auditioned for a production but they're actually mute. They were mute through trauma and had a very bad traumatic experience that they stopped speaking like 3 or 4 years before. They still attended the school and just they never spoke again. And then they arrived for auditions one day and it was the first time that everyone heard them speak. They were really good and I put them in the production and the first time everyone heard them speak again was on stage and it was life-changing.
<br><br>
Hope these tips help you take on the school year and wish you all the best in your journey. Make sure to ask these teachers more!

                                <strong>Author: Arshia Sharma</strong>

                                Unity. The state of being united or joined as a whole. Whether it be in relation to a school team or working together to solve a common problem, unity is essential in our life. With the growth of social media and its implications on all media on the rise, young children are more susceptible to its influences; so it's more important now than ever to promote the idea of strength in unity. Schools need to focus on educating children about how, despite their differences, they can work together and accomplish brilliant things. The question behind all this though, is why? Why is unity such an important idea? <br>
<br>
To begin with, one of the most functional reasons for promoting unity is the fact that divides only destroy us. Divisions in life incite hatred and bitterness, both of which only increase stress in society. Especially in current times; our aim should be to reduce stress, not expand it. Human nature itself desires unity in life. We tend to form social groups and are able to work together to solve problems. By being united, we connect to nature and stay harmonious, spreading positivity and peace. The exact opposite is seen when we let any divides disrupt our unity- negativity is spread.<br>
<br>
The idea of growth also relates to unison. From growing as a person to being able to understand differing perspectives, true character growth stems from others. What we read (others words and beliefs), how we communicate (conversation and arguments) and the media we consume (different perspectives) all contribute to our individual growth. Engaging others in provoking conversations encourages us to understand each other better, promoting more unison and harmony. This is important for us because character growth is what allows us to become the best versions of ourselves- something we should all strive for. <br>
<br>
Relating back to schools and the education system, unity plays an integral part in maintaining a harmonious society. The more advanced and sooner we teach children about the benefits of it, the more hopes we have for a peaceful future. Therefore, schools should aim to educate children about this; how to embrace different perspectives whilst solidifying their own.

                                <strong>Author: Daniele Chernyak</strong><br><br>
                                Think of a classic movie antagonist - a big bad bully who only causes trouble and torments the protagonist. It is so easy to think that these people only exist as fictional characters, and that may be true as it is rare to see those stereotypes. However, bullying has shape-shifted, and it is still so prevalent today (Facts About Bullying, 2021). It has been responsible for so many lives being tainted with self doubt and self loathing that addressing bullying has become an even more important issue to talk about.<br />
<br />
Two years ago it was reported that 1 out of 4 students in Singapore are bullied or have experienced bullying (Lim, 2021). Fortunately, there are a few different categories that help to better understand the different types of bullying (Singapore Children's Society, 2021).<br />
<br />
First up is physical bullying. Physical bullying has long become taboo in many societies, and many schools have zero-tolerance policies for it. However, when thinking of bullying, physical bullying is the usual stereotype, which can blind many people from seeing other toxic behaviours in their communities that are considered bullying.<br />
<br />
What are those harmful behaviours? Well, they can be separated into relational and verbal bullying. This includes even small things spreading rumours or, even in a joking manner, malicious teasing, ridiculing, and intimidating someone else. The true issue lies in underestimating the effects of such actions on the recipients; with enough time that they are made fun of for their hair or style or race or gender or grades, the more likely it is that those are going to have an impact in the long term.<br />
<br />
With the sudden development of youths using technology, cyber bullying has unfortunately evolved too. The whole reason why it is so prevalent is because it feels so harmless to write impertinent comments and jokes when it all happens virtually; when all the words are being cast out into the great and endless void of other rude words. However, virtual or verbal, words can sting beyond what many of the bullies intend.<br />
<br />
So here is the question that haunts all school assemblies and mental-health advocates? Of course, there is no universal answer for an issue that includes so many people, however, perhaps the only way to understand it would be through a paradox. Bullying is the result of lack of unity, and yet it leads to more people lacking unity. Bullies are just people who, at some point in their lives, lacked or lack a supportive community who provide a sense of unity, and thus, bullies find satisfaction in isolating others instead.<br />
<br />
School communities, workplaces, and households all need to take a leap into compassion for bullying to come to an end, as it will open the window of deeper understanding of others, as well as an open mind. <br />
<br />
Unity is something that can be achieved through changing the perspectives in current society, and with the passion and empathy of the younger generations, change is already around the corner.<br />
<br />
If you are being bullied, feel like you are contributing to bullying, or are noticing abusive behaviour in your peers, don&rsquo;t stay silent and hidden. Seek help, so that the future could become brighter.
